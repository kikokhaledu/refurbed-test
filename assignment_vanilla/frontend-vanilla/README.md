# Frontend - Vanilla JavaScript

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher

## Running the Development Server

```bash
cd frontend-vanilla
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Building for Production

## Alternative: Run without Node.js

You can also use Python's built-in server:

```

Or any other static file server.

## Backend Connection
